# nic_phys

Authors: Cole Dudley & Tanner Flagg
Language: Python

src/nic - contains the functions for sending and receiving bit patterns

to test this 2 devices are needed. One to send information and one to receive.
run the programs at the same time and watch the receiver print the messages sent from the sender
using a loop or multiple calls of both nic_send() and nic_receive() will be useful so that more than 1 4 bit
sequence can be read at once
